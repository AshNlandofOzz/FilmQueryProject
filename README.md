# FilmQueryProject
A simple menu program for accessing different film related data. If your interested in the list of actors for classic titles such as Antitrust Tomatoes and Breakfast Goldfinger this application is perfect for you, and maybe call your psychiatrist because you may be off your meds.

# Description
This application provides data to the user based on the Film ID number provided or a keyword. This pulls up some of the more basic key information like release year, and the actors in the cast. The user can also obtain more information, such as the rental rates and replacement cost, in the submenu.

# TechnologyUsed
I used mySQL for the database and built the application in the Java language. From my IDE Maven was employed in the composition of the application.

# LessonsLearned
I found that using Java to access the database in a command line application wasn't necessarily difficult. It was more a matter of doing it cleanly that turned out to be difficult. There was a lot of repetitive code required in the database but I was unsure how to make it more dry without disconnecting key parts of the code and rendering it useless. I would like to work on making it more concise or dry.
